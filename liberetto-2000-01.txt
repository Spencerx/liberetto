== COMMENT ---...-.-...-.--...-.--...-.-...-.....---..-....--.--..-.-.---.--

   Near the end of the last Millennium...

   The world rolled through midnight like a drunk rolling in the gutter...
   As the scythe of midnight cut across the globe, millions of voices
   uttered the same prayer: "My god, I hope it works!"

   As we now know, most firework displays worked faultlessly, with none of
   the major incidents expected.

   Likewise the computers - Y2k now appearing to have been a hoax put up
   by the food industry in order to shift warehouses full of frozen
   chicken, pasta, and sardines.  The big question now is not 'will it
   work?', but 'how come it worked?'  Countries like Bakustan, which spent
   exactly three dollars to check-out their nuclear power plants had no
   more Y2K trouble than the US, which spent over US$ thirteen trillion,
   severely curtailing other critical spending such as nice wooden toilet
   seats for the Space Shuttle program.

   Pre-Y2K visions of apocalypse had programmers being chased by wild mobs
   demanding to know why their video recorders and dishwashers no longer
   worked.  Now the mobs are of financial officers demanding to know why
   the bill includes items like 'Replaced Y2K-incompatible swimming pool'
   and 'Travel expenses for Y2K early warning system in Kiribati'.  It
   will be years before all those hastily-trained Cobol programmers can be
   returned to productive jobs at supermarket check-outs and advertising
   agencies.

   At least we all had great fun clearing out the attics, junking all
   those undocumented programs, and incompatible PCs. The tax advantages
   of Y2K alone made it all worthwhile.

   So, I wish you a very happy third millennium, and if you need some
   recipes for chicken and pasta, see http://post-y2k-cuisine.com/.

== REPORT -..----...---.-.----...---..----..-.-.-...-.-.-.---....---.-.-.---

   iMatix.com@Bazaar.Org

   The northern European city of Edinburgh organizes a yearly festival of
   arts, music, and theater.  The Festival is a staid, boring affair, but
   attracts hundreds of artists who organize the 'Fringe festival', held
   in small back rooms and on the streets.  The Fringe is where the action
   is.

   Likewise for the e-Business Expo in New York City in December, at the
   Jacob Javits center.  The real action was upstairs in a back room,
   hosting 'The Bazaar', a conference and expo for the Open Source
   community.

   The Bazaar was a mix of the raw materials of the Internet.  At the one
   end was the Free Software Foundation, selling T-shirts (I bought two)
   and starring Richard Stallman - aka RMS, the Guru of free software.
   RMS likes people to refer to 'Linux/GNU' and will not wear T-shirts
   with writing on them.  (Not even the iMatix "It's linger fickin' good!"
   ones, I'm sorry to report.)  RMS and his followers wear long hair and
   beards, except the women, looking every bit like a sect from California.
   Which they are, pretty much, except that this sect produced the heart
   and soul of the Internet (the brains, legs, and other body being parts
   collected over the years from university hospitals and army med tents)
   (and various parts of the lower digestive tract coming from Redmond).
   Ironically, RMS does not use the Internet on his own PC.  He says it's
   a long and complex story.

   At the other end of this ad-hoc village was the capitalist Andover.Net
   pavilion, hosting a number of projects, from Slashdot.org to FreeBSD.
   I spoke to the gentleman behind FreeBSD, whose name I forget.  He was
   getting his mind around an electronic commerce system to sell FreeBSD
   on line.  Ironic, given the big e-Business bash downstairs.

   I also met John 'Maddog' Hall, who is famous for something, and Eric
   Raymond, who is also famous for something.  Meeting Eric was a real
   pleasure.  He reads Liberetto.  He has a paragraph from Liberetto in
   his sig file (something to do with Windows and pain).  I presented him
   with the Millennium Edition of Liberetto, all 4 volumes bound in a neat
   3.5" gold-plated plastic binder.  :-)

   As commercial opportunities go, the Bazaar was not striking.  A total
   of 3.000 people paid to see Homo Hackerus in a mockup of his native
   ecosystem (there was no pizza).  Even that figure seems suspiciously
   high.  There were so few visitors that by the second day the organizers
   began shipping-in groups of students and busloads of retirees looking
   like they'd been snatched from caravan parks in Florida.  The students
   were interested in knowing what Linux was, and the free software.  The
   retirees were much more efficient.  Bypassing all 'What do you do' and
   'How does it work', they just went for the T-shirts and anything shiny.
   Carpe Scryptum.

   Andover.Net gave a party, and the beer was free, to the delight of most
   except RMS, who designed Free Software to be almost exactly unlike free
   beer.  Years of 'free as in free speech, not free beer' down the drain
   in one evening.  There is now a name for the motion your hand makes when
   opening a beer bottle - it's the 'Open Beer Movement'.

   The iMatix crew did a great job, and accounted for about half of the
   sushi consumed in Manhattan that weekend.  Our stand was colorful and
   piled to the top with T-shirts, CDs, gold-plated diskettes, and pens.

   We still have some T-shirts left: if you want one, drop us line.  There
   are two models: "iMatix@Bazaar '99", and "it's linger' fickin good",
   which made it past the censor after much discussion and a small white
   envelope under the table.

   First ten people to ask get a t-shirt sent to them...  :-)

   Y2K Conversions Completed, Finallk!!
       We have this report from one of our correspondents: "after mank
       months of drudgerk, and some delak, we finished the conversion
       successfullk on Thursdak Januark 6th."

   GSL is dead - Long Live GSL!
       The iMatix language formerly known as the 'Generic Schema Language'
       is undergoing a serious metamorphose.  Up to now, GSL was mainly
       aimed at code generation.  The all-new GSL/2.000 is extensible,
       faster, and has many more functions.  It's the ideal tool for XML
       transformation, web development, reporting, scripting, and - still -
       code generation.  We'll be bringing a full report in Liberetto V/3.
       GSL/2.000 is an Open Source product, slated for release in February
       2000.

   iMatix Linguist
       iMatix announces the development of "iMatix Linguist", a new product
       to develop multi-language applications.  iMatix Linguist provides
       fast, dictionary-based translation of HTML pages, ASP applications,
       C, Visual Basic, Java,...  Due for beta release in 2nd quarter 2000.
       iMatix Linguist will be available in a free personal edition and a
       retail edition.  Prices are still to be announced.

   Xitami 2.5 Nears Production Status
       Our Xitami web server has been in beta release for some time and
       will be release for production use soon.  Version 2.5 adds many new
       features, including server-side XML processing, GSL scripting, ISAPI
       support, built-in SSI support, transfer throttling, a dynamic DNS
       client, and direct support for PHP/4 and Java Servlets.

   We moved to this quiet & rural area (Pt. Reyes, Calif.) -- mostly dairy
   farms -- last summer.  The chief entertainment here seems to be waiting
   for the Thursday issue of the local newspaper, and then reading (aloud)
   the Sheriff's Calls column.  The only folks with more than a 56K modem
   access to the Internet are the guys up in the former Livery Stable (now
   converted to offices) who do their translations of the For Dummies
   books, accessing the world with a T1 line -- the only one for 25 miles
   in any direction.
   As for myself (no, you didn't ask, but aren't you interested in your
   readership?), I'm a refugee from Silicon Valley (hardware, buses,
   engineering management) currently consulting to mom-and-pop startups
   in jewelry manufacturing and (building) architecture....
   Thanks to YOU for a lively and entertaining millennium of news and
   commentary on the world.  Our best for '00 -- oops, I mean 2000.

   Ah, it's always a pleasure to hear from our readers.  Welcome to the

   Hi!
   What's up? Are you drunk, after some awesome party or what?  Three
   tries, and only a small, short Liberetto as a result... and even that
   is an attachment. You just can't do this to us Liberetto addicts!

   Once, a disciple asked his master: "Master, how does one create a
   Liberetto?"  The master replied: "One takes a random bit-string, and one
   removes those bits that do not form part of the Liberetto".  The disciple
   reflected for a while, then he replied: "Master, how does one recognize
   those bits that form part of the Liberetto?".  The master instructed the
   disciple to kneel on the ground, and then hit the disciple on the head
   with a copy of the "Office 2000 Developer's Guide".  The disciple was
   thus enlightened.
   Or, as a friend once said: "what's the difference between a Liberetto
   and a bottle of wine?"  Answer: "They are both identical, except that
   the wine is free."
   I hope this explains everything.

   Dear Liberetto,
   I just wanted to congratulate everyone at iMatix and to wish you all
   happiness and peace for the new Millennium! I have read every issue of
   Liberetto from the first issue, and sit nervously biting my nails
   every month until it arrives!
   Aside from the occasional masterpieces of literary genius exhibited in
   the newsletter, every one of your products is an excellent piece of work.
   Not only have I found Xitami, Libero, the SFL, SMT and GSL among the most
   useful products I have used, but must also congratulate you on your
   incredible commitment to Open Source and real, solid support.  (The
   latter which you give out with such utter abandon that I often fear for
   your health!)
   Enjoy New York, and save some of those T-shirts for those of us who can't
   make it!
   Regards,
   Glenn    


   I think this constitutes the first request for an iMatix conference
   T-shirt.  Send us your mailing address, Glenn.  One down, nine to go.
   Ps. we like the "you guys are fantastic" stuff.  Keep it coming!!

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi!
   I enjoyed this afternoon going through your site, reading documentation
   and the other stuff... the software I will try at home.
   Is it possible to write a schema that will generate no tables? (the
   transitions are to be handle by direct function calls, and there will
   be those really pretty deep nested if-else and case statements....
   mmmm!)  It should be possible from what I gather, but it's better to
   double check first! :)
   Well, there's another question... Somewhere I read that GSLgen is the
   future of Libero - and in some future they will go together. Is there
   any new development in the area?
   best regards,
   Vlad Dumitrescu


   Curiously, the answer to your first question is contained somewhere in
   the second.  Libero generates a compact table-driven state machine.
   This is excellent for large state machines because it is compact even
   when you have dozens or hundreds of states and events.
   A nice alternative is to use GSLgen and an XML state machine format.
   It is really easy to produce nested case statements to make the state
   machine work.  Let's look at a small example of an XML state machine:

       <fsm name = "todo">
       <state name = "initial" >
           <event name = "ok"     nextstate = "pending" />
           <event name = "cancel" action = "terminate" />
       </state>
       <state name = "pending" >
           <event name = "close"  nextstate = "closed" />
           <event name = "change" action = "edit" nextstate = "editing"/>
           <event name = "delete" action = "terminate" />
       </state>
       <state name = "closed" >
           <event name = "purge" action = "terminate" />
           <event name = "renew" action = "edit" nextstate = "editing" />
       </state>        
       <state name = "editing" >
           <event name = "ok"    action = "save" nextstate = "pending" />
           <event name = "cancel" action = "cancel" nextstate = "pending" />
           <event name = "delete" action = "terminate" />
       </state>
       </fsm>

   This shows a simple FSM that describes how we work with an item in a
   To-Do list.  It's not as sophisticated as a Libero FSM since each event
   allows only one action, but this is easy to change.  Now, let's use a
   GSL script to generate some VisualBasic code to calculate the action and
   next state for a given state and event:

       action = ""
       select case cur_state
       .for state
           case "$(name)"
               select case cur_event
       .   for event
                   case "$(name)"
                       cur_state = "$(nextstate)"
       .       for action
                       action    = "$(name)"
       .       endfor
       .   endfor
               end select
       .endfor
       end select

   Today, GSLgen can produce this kind of code easily.  The next release
   (GSL/2000) will be able to produce the kind of table-driven FSMs that
   Libero produces.  At some point, GSLgen will replace the current code-
   generation engine in Libero.

   Subject:        	Xitami Server
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi folks,
    Just a short note to say....Xitami is the best web server we have tried.
   We are running 4 virtual servers on remote (Free) DNS and one main
   server and this thing flies! I have tried Apache and Sambar and nothing
   comes even close to the speed of Xitami when executing about 2000 CGI's
   per day. Combined with ActiveState's Perl this thing is absolutely the
   best damned piece of software I have ever seen. We are running Version
   2.4d6 and I can't wait for the new version with the SSI's built in!  We
   are averaging more than 34,000 total hits per day and have yet to have a
   single problem. Thanks for a super piece of software!
   T. Pearcy
   http://mse.net/


   People tell us that Xitami is at its best when handling dozens of
   virtual hosts.  Apache starts to get slow when you do this.  Xitami
   uses so few resources for each virtual host that we've heard of people
   running hundreds of virtual hosts on one PC.
